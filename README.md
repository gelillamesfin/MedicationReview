### Application specifications and requirements
Your project must use the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.  
* Browsing medications and reading reviews is open to guests, but adding, updating, and deleting functionality is restricted to logged-in users.
* State properties in all components and services should be declared as a `signal`.
* Implement proper lazy-loading techniques for the user-protected components.
* Projects must use Angular Material and have proper UI that complies with the web standards. Other UI kits are not permitted.
* You must use the latest Angular version features, and avoid using any legacy Angular APIs. 
* You must use the `ReactiveFormsModule` when working with form elements (data-driven). The `FormsModule` (template-driven) should not be used.
